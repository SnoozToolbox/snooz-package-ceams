class AECConnectivity(SciNode):
    """
    This node computes Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC) connectivity from EEG epochs.

    Workflow
    --------
    1) Stack input epochs into a 3D array with shape (num_epochs, num_channels, num_samples).
    2) Treat non-finite values (NaN/Inf) as artifacts; convert to NaN so they can be dropped.
    3) Remove artifact windows by dropping any epoch that contains NaN or zeros (across any channel/sample).
    4) For each remaining epoch, compute AEC between all channel pairs using:
       - Hilbert transform to extract amplitude envelopes
       - Leakage correction via linear regression to reduce volume conduction
       - Pearson correlation between corrected envelopes
    5) Return the per-epoch AEC and the average across epochs, along with channel names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epochs : list[EpochModel]
        Each EpochModel has .samples (2D array W×T: epochs × samples), .sample_rate, .channel.
    events : pandas.DataFrame
        Present for interface consistency; not used by the computation here.

    Returns
    -------
    aec_results : dict
        {
        "final_aec":   (num_epochs_kept, C, C) array of AEC per epoch,
        "average_aec": (C, C) array = mean over kept epochs,
        "channel_names": list[str] of channel labels
        }
    
    Notes
    -----
    Unlike dPLI and wPLI, AEC does not include surrogate-based statistical correction,
    as the leakage correction step already addresses spurious connectivity from volume conduction.

    Compute Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC) between all pairs of channels.
    
    AEC measures connectivity by computing the correlation between amplitude envelopes

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1) For each channel pair (i, j):
       a) Apply leakage correction: remove linear influence of channel i from channel j
       b) Compute Hilbert envelopes for both corrected and reference signals
       c) Mean-center the envelopes

    2) Symmetrize the matrix and set diagonal to 0

        Real-valued time series for one epoch.

    Returns
    -------
    aec : ndarray, shape (num_channels, num_channels)
