* Launch Git Bash

			$ git clone https://github.com/SnoozToolbox/snooz-toolbox.git

* Run the script to add the local settings to your git ignore.
		
			$ ./gitignore_local_settings.sh

# The proposed Git strategy 
We propose to work on a feature or debug branch in order to keep the main always in a working state.
	Add/commit/push your local modifications from your branch as often as possible.
	This allows to save your last modification on the remote server.
	Enter a log message for each commit to make your changes trackable.
	Once your feature is validated you add it to the main.
	There are many techniques available, use the one you prefer.
	Here we describe how to squash multiple commits from a feature branch into one clean commit in the main.

### Create your branch
	$ git branch branch_name
	$ git checkout branch_name

### Create, modify, delete your files
All your modifications are local only, you can always revert your change to go back to the last commit.

### Add and commit your changes in the current branch
	$ git add . --all
	$ git commit -m "your personal log message"

### Push your change into the remote reposity server
The first time you push on a new branch you have to push with the option --set-upstream
	$ git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
otherwise
	$ git push

### Squash multiple commits from a feature branch into the main
Once your feature is validated and you want to add it to the main.

	https://gist.github.com/patik/b8a9dc5cd356f9f6f980
Switch to the main branch and make sure you are up to date
	$ git checkout main
	$ git pull
Merge your feature branch into the main branch locally
	$ git merge branch_name
To solve conflicts
	To get the file from the feature branch
		$ git checkout --theirs path_to_file
	To get the file from the main 
		$ git checkout --ours path_to_file
Reset the local main branch to origin's state:
	$ git reset origin/main
Now all of your changes are considered as unstaged changes. 
You can test snooz, run pipeline, validate and modify the files if needed.
You can add/commit/push them into one clean commit that includes the whole code for a feature.
	$ git add . --all
	$ git commit -m "Your log message"
	$ git push

# Other useful commands

## To get the local git status (file modified locally)
	$ git status

## To get the last remote version of a file
	$ git checkout path_to_file

## To go back to the last remote version of a current branch 
When you want to get rid of all the local modifications
	$ git reset --hard HEAD
	$ git reset --hard origin/branch_name

## How to branch
To list branches all branches
	$ git branch -a
To list active remote branch
	$ git ls-remote --heads origin
To delete branch locally
	$ git branch -d branch_name
To delete branch remotely
	$ git push origin --delete branch_name
To delete all local branches
	$ git branch | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -D 
To rename a remote branch
	$ git checkout <old_name>
	$ git branch -m <new_name>
	$ git push origin -u <new_name>
	$ git push origin --delete <old_name>
	
## How to manage conflicts
*** Git merge scenario ***
Ours is the current branch (destination of the merge)
Theirs is the branch to merge into (source of the merge)
You have to checkout the destination branch

	To merge the feature branch (source) into the main (destination)
		$ git checkout main
		$ git merge branch_name
	To select the changes done in main (destination)
		$ git checkout --ours /path/to/file
	To select the changes done in the feature branch (source)
		$ git checkout --theirs /path/to/file

	To merge the main (source) into the feature branch (destination)
		$ git checkout branch_name
		$ git merge main
	To select the changes done in main (source)
		$ git checkout --theirs /path/to/file
	To select the changes done in feature (destination)
		$ git checkout --ours /path/to/file

## To TAG
Example to tag the main
	$ git checkout main
	$ git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "first version distributed v1.0.0"
	$ git push origin v1.0.0
To checkout a tagged version
	$ git checkout v1.0.0
To delete the tag on any remote before you push
	$ git push origin :refs/tags/<tagname>
To replace the tag to reference the most recent commit
	$ git tag -fa <tagname>
	$ git push -f origin <tagname>
To tag an older commit
	$ git tag -a vx.x.x commit_id -m "message"
	$ git push origin --tags
	ex) $ git tag -a v0.3.0 122cbd2 -m "RapidEyeMovementTools linked to CEAMSModules v3.0.0"
		$ git push origin --tags 
git tag -a v1.0.0 f4ebce6 -m "Snooz with CEAMSModules v2.0.0 and CEAMSTools v2.0.0"
To rename a tag
	# Create a new local tag named `new` from tag `old`.
	$ git tag new old          
	# Delete local tag `old`.
	$ git tag -d old       
	# Push `new` to your remote named "origin", and delete    
	$ git push origin new :old 
	# tag `old` on origin (by pushing an empty tag name to it).

## To add back a file tracked in git
	$ git update-index --no-skip-worktree path_to_file
		ex) git update-index --no-skip-worktree .vscode/launch.json

## How to ignore new ext file
Make changes in .gitignore file.
	$ git status
